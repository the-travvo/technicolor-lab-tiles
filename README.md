# Technicolor Lab Tiles

Technicolor Lab Tiles is a mod for Factorio that adds lab tiles with fully saturated colors. Optionally compatible with the Space Age mod. Requires Factorio v 2.0 or greater.

## Development

This was originally developed as a supplement to the Factorio Printer project located [HERE](https://github.com/the-travvo/Factorio-Printer-v3). I wanted items of fully saturated colors to be able to print saturated pictures. Obviously the colors go against the realistic palette of the game, so I leaned into this with the recipe involving radioactive ingredients, Ã  la watches painted with radium in the early 20th century. 

This is my first Factorio mod, and what I don't know about Factorio modding is basically everything. Please reach out if there's anything that needs obvious fixing, or if you are interested in collaborating or adding cross-mod functionality.
